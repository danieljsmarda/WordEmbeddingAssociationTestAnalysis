# Welcome

This repository accompanies the paper <paper_name_here>. 

# Environment Setup

This code was created and tested with [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) version 4.9.1.

To rerun this code, clone the repo into a local folder. Then, follow [the instructions for creating an environment from a .yml file on the conda website](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).

# Code structure
The structure of this repository loosely follows the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) template:

- All data is read from or written to the `data` folder, except for saved visualizations, which are stored in `reports`. If you are reproducing this experiment, it is recommended that you clear your `data` folder first before you add your word embedding model and create results files.
-
